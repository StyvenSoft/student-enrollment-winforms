# Student Enrollment Winforms

Application with the Windows Forms graphical interface and the C # programming language.

## Problem Statement

It is required that, through an application developed in the C # programming language, either in console mode or with a Windows Forms graphical interface, it serves as a simulator to calculate the amount to be paid for a student's tuition. Taking into account that the value of the academic credit of the disciplinary courses is $ 112,000, if it is from stratum 1, you will receive a 50% discount on the total value of the tuition.

It is expected that the runtime application will ask the user to enter the name of the student, the stratum to which they belong, and the number of credits to enroll; With these data, the application will make the calculations and as a result of the execution, it will display on the screen the name of the student, the socio-economic stratum to which it belongs and the amount to be paid.

## Functional requirements

El lenguaje de programación a utilizar para el curso es C# que hace parte el Entorno de Desarrollo Integrado IDE Visual Studio Community 2019, el cual se descarga directamente de la página oficial de [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/) 

When executing the application, it will show on the screen as initial information the full name of the student, the name of the application, the name of the course and will ask to enter the generic access password that will be: 123, as a basic security level, in such a way that if If the correct password is entered, it will take you to another screen or interface to enter the student's data in the simulator and display the result on the screen.
